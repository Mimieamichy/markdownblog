Next.js is a powerful React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.

## Why Next.js?

* **File-based routing:** Easy page management via the `pages/` directory.  
* **SSR & SSG:** Supports both server-side rendering and static generation.  
* **API Routes:** Create backend endpoints inside the project.  

## Example

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
