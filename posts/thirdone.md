Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during development. It's essential for modern collaborative software development and is widely used with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

## Key Benefits

* **Collaboration:** Work with multiple developers on the same codebase efficiently.
* **History:** Track every change made to the code, and revert to earlier versions when needed.
* **Branching:** Safely experiment with new features in isolated branches.
* **Merging:** Combine changes from different branches smoothly.
* **Backup:** Your entire code history is stored locally and can also be pushed to remote repositories.

## Basic Workflow

Here's a typical Git workflow when starting a new project:

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit the staged files with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"
