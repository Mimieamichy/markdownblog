CSS Grid is a powerful two-dimensional layout system that gives you precise control over your design, both horizontally and vertically. It is supported in all modern browsers and is a great choice for creating complex, responsive web layouts with clean and maintainable code.

## Why CSS Grid?

* **Powerful:** Define rows and columns independently and place items anywhere in the grid.  
* **Responsive:** Use media queries and `auto-fit`/`auto-fill` for fluid grid layouts across screen sizes.  
* **Semantic:** Reduces the need for extra wrapper elements and deeply nested structures.  
* **Alignment:** Offers easy control over spacing, alignment, and distribution of elements.

## Basic Example

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
