This is the first post on our new blog! It's built using **Next.js** and renders content directly from Markdown files located in the `posts` directory.

## Features

*   **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Posts are pre-rendered at build time for maximum performance.
*   **Dynamic Routing:** Each post gets its own page automatically based on the filename.
*   **Markdown Support:** Write content easily using standard Markdown syntax.
*   **SEO Friendly:** Includes basic meta tags for better search engine visibility.

```javascript
// Example code block
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

We hope you enjoy reading the content here! Stay tuned for more updates.
