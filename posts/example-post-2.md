Next.js offers different rendering strategies to optimize your web applications. Two fundamental concepts are Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

With SSG, the HTML for your pages is generated at **build time**. This means when a user requests a page, the server can immediately send the pre-built HTML file.

**Pros:**
*   Extremely fast load times.
*   Reduced server load.
*   Great for SEO.
*   Can be hosted on CDNs.

**Cons:**
*   Requires a rebuild to update content (though Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) can help).
*   Not suitable for highly dynamic content that changes frequently per request.

This blog primarily uses **SSG** via `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` to pre-render blog posts.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

With SSR, the HTML for a page is generated on the **server for each request**.

**Pros:**
*   Always serves up-to-date content.
*   Good for SEO as search engines receive fully rendered HTML.
*   Suitable for pages with data that changes frequently or depends on user authentication.

**Cons:**
*   Slower Time to First Byte (TTFB) compared to SSG as the server needs to generate the page on demand.
*   Higher server load.

Next.js allows you to choose the best rendering method on a per-page basis, giving you flexibility.
